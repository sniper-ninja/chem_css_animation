# Titration Simulation

This project is a web-based simulation of a titration setup. It allows users to adjust the water level in the burette, control the stopcock rotation speed, and interact with the simulation by dragging the water droplet to create ripples in the wave.

## Demo

You can view a live demo of this simulation [here](https://sniper-ninja.github.io/chem_css_animation/).

## Installation

To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titration-simulation.git`.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

- Use the dropdown menus to adjust the water level in the burette and the stopcock rotation speed.
- Click the "Change color After titration" button to change the color of the simulation after titration.
- Drag the water droplet to interact with the wave.
